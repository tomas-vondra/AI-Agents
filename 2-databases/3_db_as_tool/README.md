3. **Easy Provider Switching**
   - Change `AI_PROVIDER` in `.env` file
   - Or set environment variable: `export AI_PROVIDER=openai`
   - Or run with inline variable: `AI_PROVIDER=openai python main.py`

### Run the Agent

```bash
uv run main.py
```

| **Internet**        | Not required            | Required                   |
| **Setup**           | Download models locally | API key only               |
| **Models**          | Open-source models      | GPT-4, GPT-3.5, etc.       |
| **Tool Calling**    | âœ… Supported            | âœ… Excellent               |
| **Educational Use** | Perfect for learning    | Great for production demos |

**Recommendation:**

- **Students/Learning**: Use Ollama (free, private, educational)
- **Production Demos**: Use OpenAI (reliable, high-quality responses)
- **Development**: Switch between both to compare results!

## ðŸ’¬ Interactive Chat Interface

The agent provides an interactive chat interface where you can ask natural language questions about data. The agent will:

1. **Analyze your query** and determine which database(s) to use
2. **Execute appropriate tool calls** to gather data
3. **Explain its reasoning** for tool selection
4. **Present results** in an educational format

### Chat Commands

- `help` or `h` - Show example queries
- `quit`, `exit`, or `q` - Exit the application
- `Ctrl+C` - Force exit

## ðŸŽ“ Educational Features

### Tool Selection Reasoning

The agent explains why it chose each database:

- **MSSQL**: For structured, transactional data requiring ACID properties
- **MongoDB**: For flexible schemas and rapid development
- **Elasticsearch**: For full-text search and real-time analytics
- **Qdrant**: For AI-powered semantic search and recommendations
- **MinIO**: For scalable object storage and media handling

### Cross-Database Workflows

See how modern applications use multiple databases together:

1. Query user profile from MSSQL
2. Get behavior data from MongoDB
3. Find similar products in Qdrant
4. Retrieve product images from MinIO
5. Log search queries to Elasticsearch

### Performance Insights

Learn about database performance characteristics:

- **MSSQL**: ACID compliance, complex queries, transactions
- **MongoDB**: Horizontal scaling, flexible schemas
- **Elasticsearch**: Near real-time search, aggregations
- **Qdrant**: Vector similarity, machine learning integration
- **MinIO**: High throughput, distributed storage

## Model Performance

**Ollama:**

- Use larger models (llama3.1:8b, llama3.1:70b) for better tool selection
- Ensure sufficient RAM (8GB+ recommended)
- Consider GPU acceleration for better performance

**OpenAI:**

- GPT-4o recommended for best tool selection
- GPT-3.5-turbo works but may be less reliable with complex tool calls
- Monitor token usage for cost control
